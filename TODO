That did it.  CPAN search was negative, incidentally (and XAO::Catalogs
isn't in the dep list for XAO::Commerce, tho you probably already knew
that).  Thanks.

Oh, and when I forgot to crease the test database I got this exception,
dunno if this is expected or if XAO::Errors isn't getting along with
Test::Unit::HarnessUnit (which I just upgraded):

ta/Catalogs....DBI->connect(test1) failed: Unknown database 'test1' at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/XAO/DO/FS/Glue/MySQL_DBI.pm line 73
Can't locate object method "to_string" via package "XAO::E::Objects" (perhaps you forgot to load "XAO::E::Objects"?) at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Test/Unit/HarnessUnit.pm line 41.

I'm not particularly motivated to investigate right now but if I find out
anything more I'll let you know.
