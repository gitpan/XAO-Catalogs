NAME
    XAO::DO::Catalogs - XAO catalog exchange module

SYNOPSIS
     xao-ifilter-sample --debug sample_site sample.xml
     xao-import-map --debug sample_site sample

DESCRIPTION
    XAO Catalogs is a Perl module that supports integrating multiple
    manufacturers' catalogs into a single products database. This can be
    used for eCommerce sites, data integration projects, and search and
    comparison engines.

METHODS
    XAO::DO::Catalogs contains only minor utility methods, all real
    functionality is in ImportMap::Base and specific import maps based on
    it.

    build_structure ()
        Builds supporting structure in the database. Does not destroy
        existing data -- safe to call on already populated database.

        Usually should be called in Config.pm's build_structure() method.

    data_structure ()
        Returns a reference to a hash that describes database structure.
        Usually you would add it to your database description in Config.pm:

         my $cobj=XAO::Objects->new(objname => 'Catalogs');

         my %structure=(
             MyData => {
                 ...
             },

             %{$cobj->data_structure},

             MyOtherData => {
                 ...
             }
         );

        If that looks ugly (it is ugly) then look at the build_structure()
        method description instead.
